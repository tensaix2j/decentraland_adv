Slashmas Warrior is a hack and slash dungeon exploring diablo-type game where you control a character and slash through hordes of monsters for loots.

Your character also has upgradable standard stats : STR, VIT, INT, DEX. Upgrading stats gives you Damage, Healthpoints and Manapoints.

There's an inventory and item system built into the game where wielding items give you additional stats.

Items can be obtained by purchasing from Shops, or random loots dropped from Monsters.


The scrolling window is used to allow having a much larger map than the visible area. As the player walks around, the scrolling window will follow the player acting as a camera for the visible area.

There are 3 bosses in the game. Killing the last one counts as completing the game and will put you to the hall of fame based on time taken. This is also known as Speed Run

Progress can be saved by paying 5 MATIC MANA, and loaded by paying another 5 MATIC MANA by simply talking to one of the NPC wearing the glasses.
( Saved progress includes all the inventory items, all the player stats. )
